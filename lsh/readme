lua-shell(lsh) is designed for people who hate(or has wasted much time on) bash script and *nix text-tools like sed, awk.

compared to bash, lsh has two features:
1, lua as script.
2, a built-in programmable vim-parser.

here are some demo displaying the features
DEMO1	
find all files  under current directory named with a ".cp" suffix and remind you before delete it.
the lsh script should be:
	for filename in lfs.dir("./") do
		if string.match(filename, ".cp") then
			print("delete " .. filename .. "?" )
			if(io.read() ~= "y" )	
				`rm $(filename);
		end
	end

DEMO2
suppose we have many files, and their names  have a similar format: xxx_rgb_xxx.png, we want to traverse these files and extract 'rgb' field(like 0xff0000) to perfrm some follow up operations.
the lsh script should be:
	for filename in lfs.dir("./") do
		vim:load(filename)
		:f_lvf_hy:		--copy to clipboard for later use
		 ... ...
		 print(vim:clipboard())	--for example
	end

DEMO3
suppose we have two files, abc.txt and 123.txt. their contents are respectively:
$ cat abc.txt:
aaa bbb ccc
aaa bbb ccc
aaa bbb ccc

$ cat 123.txt:
111 222 333
111 222 333
111 222 333

now, we want to merge them to get a new file "result.txt":
aaa 111 bbb 222 ccc 333
aaa 111 bbb 222 ccc 333
aaa 111 bbb 222 ccc 333

the corresponding lsh script should be like this:
vim:open("1.txt")
vi2 = Vi:new()
vi2:open("2.txt")
vim:share_clipboard(vi2)

for i = 0, vi2.lmax do
	vim:Gn(i)
	vi2:Gn(i)
	repeat
		vi2:normal("vey")
		:ea  :
		:p
	until vi2:normal("w_") == 0
end
vim:write("result.txt")

INSTALL   
make sure you have installed the following libraries:
(For ubuntu users)
1, sudo apt-get install libreadline6
2, sudo apt-get install luarocks
   sudo luarocks install luafilesystem   (here may cost some time)
3, sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

extract the lsh-master.zip to your home directory and rename 'lsh-master' to 'lsh', and then goto ~/lsh/, run
sudo make

DOCUMENT
this version is not well documented. but you can get a brief knowledge of it through material under lsh/manual.
